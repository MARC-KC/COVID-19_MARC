# Mid-America Regional Council's COVID-19 Data

This repository holds all the code [MARC](https://www.marc.org/) uses to keep their [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://marc2.org/covidhub/) up to date for the Kansas City Region. It exposes the entire process for downloading the most up-to-date datasets from our [COVIDv2 Map Server](https://gis2.marc2.org/arcgis/rest/services/HumanServices/COVIDv2/MapServer) through the REST API and transforming it to the forms needed to feed the [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://marc2.org/covidhub/).
